# Launch Control Feature

## Overview

The Launch Control feature is a comprehensive water management control panel that provides real-time monitoring, system control, and emergency management capabilities. It adheres to the glassmorphism-ui theme with beautiful glass effects, animations, and interactive controls.

## Features

### 🎛️ System Control Panel
- **Flow Control System**: Toggle water flow control on/off
- **Temperature Control**: Manage temperature regulation systems
- **Quality Monitoring**: Control water quality monitoring systems
- **Auto Mode**: Enable automatic system management
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Immediate system shutdown capability

### 📊 Real-time System Monitor
- **Animated Metrics Display**: Live updates with smooth animations
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status indicators (Normal, Warning, Critical)
- **Progress Bars**: Real-time progress visualization for each metric
- **System Health Summary**: Overview of system status

### 🚨 Emergency Controls
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Safely shut down all systems
- **Reset All Systems**: Return systems to default state
- **Update Metrics**: Manually refresh system data

### 🔄 Auto-refresh System
- **Smart Monitoring**: Automatic metric updates when auto mode is enabled
- **Real-time Data**: Continuous system monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient update cycles

## Components

### LaunchControlScreen (`app/launch-control.tsx`)
The main screen that orchestrates all Launch Control functionality.

### SystemMonitor (`components/SystemMonitor.tsx`)
A sophisticated component that displays real-time system metrics with:
- Animated value transitions
- Status-based color coding
- Progress bar visualization
- Critical metric highlighting

## System Metrics

The Launch Control monitors the following key metrics:

| Metric | Unit | Normal Range | Critical Thresholds |
|--------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| Flow Rate | L/min | 0-2000 | >1800 L/min |
| Temperature | °C | 15-35 | <18°C or >30°C |
| pH Level | - | 6.5-8.5 | <6.8 or >8.2 |
| Pressure | Bar | 1.5-4.0 | <2.0 or >3.5 |
| Oxygen Level | mg/L | 6.0-12.0 | <7.0 mg/L |

## Usage

### Navigation
1. From the home screen, tap the "Launch Control" button
2. The Launch Control screen will open with full system overview

### System Control
1. Use the toggle switches to enable/disable individual systems
2. Enable "Auto Mode" for automatic system management
3. Monitor real-time metrics in the System Monitor section

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Emergency Shutdown**: Tap the red "Emergency Shutdown" button
2. **System Reset**: Use "Reset All Systems" to return to default state
3. **Manual Updates**: Tap "Update Metrics" to refresh system data

### Auto Mode
- When enabled, the system automatically updates metrics every 5 seconds
- Provides continuous monitoring without manual intervention
- Can be disabled at any time for manual control

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follows React Native best practices

### Animations
- Smooth value transitions using Animated API
- Pulse animations for critical metrics
- Performance-optimized with native driver where possible

### Glassmorphism Theme
- Consistent with the overall app design
- Uses BlurView for glass effects
- Proper color schemes and transparency

## File Structure

```
app/
├── launch-control.tsx          # Main Launch Control screen
└── (tabs)/
    └── index.tsx              # Home screen with Launch Control button

components/
└── SystemMonitor.tsx          # Real-time monitoring component
```

## Dependencies

- `expo-blur`: For glassmorphism effects
- `expo-linear-gradient`: For background gradients
- `@expo/vector-icons`: For system icons
- `react-native`: Core React Native functionality

## Customization

### Adding New Metrics
1. Update the `SystemMetrics` interface
2. Add the metric to the `systemMetricsData` array
3. Define critical thresholds and ranges

### Modifying Control Systems
1. Update the `ControlState` interface
2. Add new toggle controls to the UI
3. Implement corresponding logic in handlers

### Styling Changes
1. Modify the StyleSheet objects
2. Update color schemes in the constants
3. Adjust glassmorphism intensity values

## Performance Considerations

- Animations use native driver where possible
- Efficient state updates with proper dependency arrays
- Cleanup of intervals and animations on component unmount
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management

## Future Enhancements

- **Data Logging**: Historical data tracking and analysis
- **Alert System**: Push notifications for critical events
- **Remote Control**: API integration for remote system management
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-based predictive maintenance
- **Multi-system Support**: Support for multiple water management facilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Metrics not updating**: Check if Auto Mode is enabled
2. **Animations not working**: Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect
3. **Performance issues**: Verify native driver usage for animations

### Debug Mode
- Console logs for system state changes
- Alert confirmations for critical actions
- Visual feedback for all user interactions

## Contributing

When adding new features to the Launch Control system:
1. Follow the existing code structure and patterns
2. Maintain the glassmorphism theme consistency
3. Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
4. Include appropriate error handling
5. Test on both iOS and Android platforms
